Usage
-----

 - go to {}/idp/register/
 - choose "Create a new WebID for my Pod"
 - enter pod name, email and password
     note: No verification will be done on the email, you can put any arbitrairy email address
  - You should be able to see you pod at {}/your_podname, but the recipe is buggy for the moment, it is still work in progress.
    As an alternative, you can see your pod using Vincent Tunru Penny website:  https://penny.vincenttunru.com/ by login with your freshly created webID
